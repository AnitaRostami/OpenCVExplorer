# OpenCV Tutorial Repository

Welcome to the **OpenCV Explorer Repository**! This repository is dedicated to sharing beginner-friendly tutorials and code examples for learning **OpenCV** with Python. Whether you're new to computer vision or looking to expand your skills, this collection aims to provide clear, practical examples to help you get started.

## About This Repository
The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of tutorials covering fundamental OpenCV concepts, such as:
- Reading, writing, and displaying images and videos
- Drawing geometric shapes on images
- Configuring camera parameters
- Adding text overlays (e.g., date and time) on videos
- Handling mouse events for interactive applications
- Display Mouse Coordinates
- Draw Lines with Mouse Drag
- Crop Image Region with Mouse Selection
- Color Picker on Image
- Interactive Free Drawing with Modes
- Bitwise Operations
- Simple Image Thresholding (OpenCV Display)
- Simple Image Thresholding (Matplotlib Display)
- Adaptive Thresholding
- Morphological Transformations
- Blurring Techniques
- Image Gradients and Edge Detection 
- Gaussian Pyramid
- Multiple Gaussian Pyramid
- Image Blending Using Pyramids
- Drawing All Contours with Different Colors
- Drawing Specific Contours with Labels
- Motion Detection
- Detect Simple Geomentic Shapes
- Image Histograms
- Template Matching
- Standard Hough Line Transform
- Probabilistic Hough Line Transform
- Region of Interest Demonstration
- Lane Line Detection
- And more!

Each tutorial includes well-commented Python code, detailed explanations, and instructions to run the examples in a Jupyter Notebook or as standalone scripts.

## Inspiration and Added Value
This repository builds upon the excellent **OpenCV Python Tutorial For Beginners** by [ProgrammingKnowledge](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgrammingKnowledge). While the original tutorial provides a solid foundation for learning OpenCV, this repository enhances it by:
- **Expanding the Scope**
- **More Practical Examples**
- **Improved Explanations**
- **Enhanced Code**
- **Regular Updates**

By building on the foundation laid by ProgrammingKnowledge, this repository aims to provide a richer, more interactive learning experience for the OpenCV community. My goal is to make computer vision accessible to everyone by sharing these enhanced resources and encouraging collaboration.

## Updates
This repository is a work in progress and will be **regularly updated** with new tutorials, improved code examples, and additional OpenCV topics. Stay tuned for more advanced techniques and real-world applications as the repository grows.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for new tutorials, code improvements, or additional OpenCV topics, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding, and enjoy learning OpenCV!
